description: Suggestions for starting on math olympiads

---

By now I've gotten countless emails from students studying
for math olympiads that amounts to "okay, but what do I do?".
So here is, at long last, a list of suggestions.

Readers may notice this is actually just
an abridged version of the longer
[recommendations page](recommend.html) on my site.
It turns out if you make a list shorter,
people are more likely to pick up the pencil and start cracking.

I really want to stress these are mere *suggestions*.
Just because you have done everything on this list
does not mean you will achieve your goals.
Conversely, there are many fantastic resources that are not
included on this list, since I wanted to keep this list very short
(and also due to my own ignorance).
If you are looking for a list of materials which are guaranteed
to be "enough" for solving IMO #1 and #4, you have come to the wrong place.
There are few guarantees in math contests.

See also the [math contest FAQ's](FAQs/contest.html)
for some more philosophical (and less concrete) advice on studying.

### Lecture Materials

+ Combinatorics: [Pranav A. Sriram][pranav]
+ Geometry: [E.G.M.O.](geombook.html) (by me)
+ Algebra, combo, NT: [OTIS Excerpts](excerpts.html) (by me)

[pranav]: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h601134

If you've finished these and want more,
I have [a bunch more olympiad handouts](olympiad.html)
and [links to other sources](recommend.html).
(The Excerpts contain adaptations from many of the handouts,
but there are some differences, too.)

### Problem Sources

A mandatory part of any olympiad training is doing lots
of problems from past contests.
(I used to carry a binder with printouts
of the IMO shortlist and check them off as I figured them out.)

Here are some places to start
(roughly ascending order of difficulty):

+ [Canada national olympiad](https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/CMO/)
+ [European Girls Math Olympiad](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/)
+ [ELMO](elmo/problems.html)
+ [IMO Shortlist](http://imo-official.org/problems.aspx)
+ [USA Team Selection Tests](problems.html)

The bottom of the [recommendations page](recommend.html)
has some more suggestions for problems
if this list isn't sufficient.
