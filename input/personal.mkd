## {{ hl("puzzle", "Puzzle hunts") }}

I am an avid fan of the
[MIT mystery hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/huntsbyyear.html)
and other puzzle hunt activities.
I have participated in the MIT mystery hunt in 2017.
These days, I usually hunt on  ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈.

The two puzzle hunts that I worked most with were:

+ [2021 hunt](https://perpendicular.institute/):
	highlights of mine include
	[Le chiffre indéchiffrable](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/le-chiffre-indéchiffrable/)
	[Clueless](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/clueless/),
	[Divided Is Us](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/divided-is-us/).

## {{ hl("hanabi", "Hanabi") }}

[Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_\(card_game\))
is a cooperative logic-based deduction game.
I spend quite a bit of time playing Hanabi online with the 
[Hyphen-ated group](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions),
which plays the game at a rather high level,
as well as with my students.
I am [vEnhance](https://hanab.live/scores/vEnhance) on the hanab.live website.

I wrote a
[short introduction to the rules and conventions](https://tinyurl.com/hanabi-evan-intro)
to get new players up to speed,
which might be useful if you'd like to learn the rules of the game
and the basics of the Hyphen-ated conventions.

## {{ hl("games", "More games") }}

Other games I enjoy include
[StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Legacy_of_the_Void),
[Baba is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba) (logic/puzzle),
and many more.
In addition to my [Steam][steam] list,
here's a [long list of games I enjoy](games.html)
with short descriptions of each.
I generally like games with a learning curve or
games with engaging story.
