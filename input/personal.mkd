Here's a little about myself,
including things I like so much that
I think you should try them too!

## Puzzle hunts

I am an avid fan of the
[MIT mystery hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/huntsbyyear.html)
and other puzzle hunt activities.
I have participated in the MIT mystery hunt in 2017.
These days, I usually hunt on  ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈.

I was part of the organizing team for the
[2021 hunt](https://perpendicular.institute/),
themed about the Perpendicular Institute of the World.
My favorite puzzles I wrote, in roughly ascending order of length:

* [Nutrition Facts](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/nutrition-facts/)
* [Blind Calculation](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/blind-calculation/)
* [A Bit of Light](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/a-bit-of-light/)
* [Le chiffre indéchiffrable](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/le-chiffre-indéchiffrable/)
* [Clueless](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/clueless/)
* [Divided Is Us](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/divided-is-us/)
* [Escape From Life](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/escape-from-life/)
* [The IMO Shortlist](https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/the-imo-shortlist/)

I blogged about the writing of these puzzles
[here](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2021/02/18/some-puzzle-writing-thoughts-from-an-amateur/)
and
[here](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2021/02/21/unnecessarily-detailed-stories-of-my-mystery-hunt-puzzles/).

If you are totally new to puzzle hunts,
[betaveros has a good introduction](https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts).
You can find a
[index of all past mystery hunt puzzles](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/)
and it's great fun to just pick a random past puzzle to work through.

## Hanabi

[Hanabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_\(card_game\))
is a cooperative logic-based deduction game.
I spend quite a bit of time playing Hanabi online with the 
[Hyphen-ated group](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions),
which plays the game at a rather high level,
as well as with my students.
I am [vEnhance](https://hanab.live/scores/vEnhance) on the hanab.live website.

I wrote a
[short introduction to the rules and conventions](https://tinyurl.com/hanabi-evan-intro)
to get new players up to speed,
which might be useful if you'd like to learn the rules of the game
and the basics of the Hyphen-ated conventions.


## More games

Other games I enjoy include
[StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Legacy_of_the_Void),
[Baba is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba) (logic/puzzle),
and many more.
In addition to my [Steam][steam] list,
here's a [long list of games I enjoy](games.html)
with short descriptions of each.
I generally like games with a learning curve or
games with engaging story.
