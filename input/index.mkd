I am an MIT undergraduate, class of 2018.

  you might try [my course notes](coursework.html) or [other resources](recommend.html).
+ If you want to find about more about me or my work,
  you should check my [about page](about.html) and my [list of publications](publications.html).
+ If you're looking for my blog, [here it is](http://usamo.wordpress.com).

I do math and not code:
