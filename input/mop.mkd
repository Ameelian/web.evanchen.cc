## About MOP

This section of the website is dedicated to public-facing
material from various years of MOP.
It's similar in spirit to the [MOPper world](http://moppers.kaseorg.com/)
that ran between 1997 and 2004.

MOP is a three-week camp now held at [CMU](https://cmu.edu).
In 2020 and 2021, the camp was run on Discord.
Prior to 2015, the camp was held in [Nebraska](https://unl.edu).
See [FAQ CR-7](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-7)
for invitation rules.

Today, the camp is headed by director
[Po-Shen Loh](https://math.cmu.edu/~ploh)
and assistant academic director [Evan Chen](index.html).
Staff includes instructors, [RA][RA]'s, and
teaching assistants aka graders.
(There is no academic director or assistant director.)

[RA]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_assistant

For many years, the official name for MOP was "MOSP",
but the letter S was universally ignored by staff and students,
and its omission became an ongoing gag.
The S was finally officially deleted in 2017.

## Problems

- The **ELMO** is written by new MOPpers for returning MOPpers,
	featuring "teams" and coordination.
	See [ELMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/elmo/general.html).
- The **Mock IMO** is run by staff using [ISL](faq-rules.html#CR-11);
	it also features a mock
	[coordination](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-10).
	You can download the problems here:

- The staff also provide **MOP homework** to work on before camp starts,
	mostly for fun and so people have something to talk about at airport.
	Here are recent homework problems:

Traditionally, MOP T-shirts are printed in black on grey.
With the exception of 2020, usually there is only a front design,
and the back contains everyone's signature.
