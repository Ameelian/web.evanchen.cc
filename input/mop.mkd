This section of the website is dedicated to public-facing
material from various years of MOP.
It's similar in spirit to the [MOPper world](http://moppers.kaseorg.com/)
that ran between 1997 and 2004.

## About MOP

MOP is a three-week camp which in modern times is held in Carnegie Mellon
University at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
(For 2020 and 2021, the camp was run on Discord.)
Prior to 2015, the camp was held at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
See [FAQ CR-7](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-7)
for invitation rules.

At the time of writing, the camp is headed by **Po-Shen Loh (director)**
and **Evan Chen (assistant academic director)**.
There is no academic director or assistant director,
because our naming makes lots of sense.
In addition to instructors,
there is also a team of "teaching assistants"
(although we typically just call them "graders")
which help with logistical work and do the arduous task of marking exams.

## Problems

The **ELMO** is written by new MOPpers for returning MOPpers,
featuring "teams" and coordination.
See [ELMO page](https://web.evanchen.cc/elmo/general.html).
Also often open to guests the public by post on AoPS.

The **Mock IMO** is run by the staff using past Shortlist problems;
it also features a mock coordination where the six members of the IMO team.
(See [FAQ CR-10](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-rules.html#CR-10)
for coordination details.)
You can download the problems (which are just from IMO Shortlist)
for the following years.

The staff also provide **MOP homework** to work on before camp starts,
mostly for fun and so people have something to talk about at airport.
Here are homework problems from the following years.

## Singing troupe

The MOP Singing Troupe is a tradition dating back to around 2010,
started by Evan o'Dorney.
It consists of people (trying to) sing.
At each talent show, it is tradition for the singing troupe
to be the opening and closing act.

Here is repertoire from recent years (woefully incomplete).

## The letter S

For many years, the official name for MOP was "MOSP",
but the letter S was almost universally ignored by staff and students,
and the deletion of the letter S became an ongoing gag.
The S was finally officially excised starting in MOP 2017.

## T-shirts

Traditionally, MOP T-shirts are printed in black/white on grey.
This page contains art assets that were used on T-shirts in various years.
With the exception of 2020, usually there is only a front design,
and the back contains everyone's signature.

Here are images for T-shirts in recent years (click to expand).
